**Smart Bunker Environmental Monitoring System**

This project simulates a real-time sensor network designed for high-end survival bunkers or remote environmental monitoring. Using live data streamed from PubNub, the system ingests readings like radiation, temperature, humidity, and light levels. Machine learning algorithms are applied to detect unusual activity and classify sensor zones, with insights displayed in a tactical dashboard built using Streamlit.

## 📦 Features

- ✅ Real-time data ingestion from PubNub sensor network
- ✅ KMeans clustering for zone detection
- ✅ Isolation Forest anomaly detection (e.g., radiation spikes)
- ✅ Environmental alert flags (☢️ Radiation, 💧 Humidity)
- ✅ Tactical-themed Streamlit dashboard with multiple views

## 🚀 How to Run

### Step 1: Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Ingest and analyze data

```bash
python streaming_ml_project.py
python sensor_analysis.py
```

### Step 3: Launch the dashboard

```bash
streamlit run cowabunga_command_center.py
```

> You can also explore the data outputs in `sensor_anomalies.csv` and `clustered_sensor_data.csv`.
